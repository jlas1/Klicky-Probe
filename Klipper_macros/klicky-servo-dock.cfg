[servo Dock]
pin: PB6
#   PWM output pin controlling the servo. This parameter must be
#   provided.
maximum_servo_angle: 91
#   The maximum angle (in degrees) that this servo can be set to. The
#   default is 180 degrees.
minimum_pulse_width: 0.0005
#   The minimum pulse width time (in seconds). This should correspond
#   with an angle of 0 degrees. The default is 0.001 seconds.
maximum_pulse_width: 0.0025
#   The maximum pulse width time (in seconds). This should correspond
#   with an angle of maximum_servo_angle. The default is 0.002
#   seconds.
initial_angle: 45
#   Initial angle (in degrees) to set the servo to. The default is to
#   not send any signal at startup.
#initial_pulse_width:
#   Initial pulse width time (in seconds) to set the servo to. (This
#   is only valid if initial_angle is not set.) The default is to not
#   send any signal at startup.

#### Rectracted and Deployed Macro Angles are stored in Klicky-Macros.cfg
