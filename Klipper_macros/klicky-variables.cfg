# This macro was provided by discord user Garrettwp to whom i give my thanks for sharing it with me.
# I have tweaked it a lot.
# They are based on the great Annex magprobe dockable probe macros "#Originally developed by Mental,
# modified for better use on K-series printers by RyanG and Trails", kudos to them.
# That macro as since evolved into a klipper plugin that currently is pending inclusion in klipper,
# more information here, https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe/tree/main/Klipper_Macros
# User richardjm revised the macro variables and added some functions, thanks a lot
# by standing on the shoulders of giants, lets see if we can see further
#
# the current home for this version is https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe
# the 1000 values below is to give an error instead of doing something wrong, hopefully, this won't be used is a printer larger than 1 meter
