    Print Settings:
  </summary>
- Default Voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!<br>
- 40% Infill, 0,4 line width, 4 walls, 5 top/bottom. But it doesn't matter that much, you can use less infill or 3 walls and 3top/bottom to save weight.<br>
- I recommend lately to use Cura 5.0 Slicer, just because it has now variable line widths by default, which makes everything easier!<br>

    Notes:
  </summary>
You have the choice between "nut" or "insert" and the right side has additionally Endstop Versions!<br>
On the left side there isn't any endstop, so only the choice between insert or nut!<br>
The insert versions works with M3x50 or M3x55<br>
The nut versions with M3x55 or M3x60<br>
