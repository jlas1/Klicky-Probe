This a collection with all the necessary printed parts to put Klicky probe on VzBot . 
My only personal contribution is the probe dock mount that i made to fit VzBot , all the other parts are not my creation .
I made the probe dock mount with press fit m3 nuts instead of heat inserts used in the original klicky design. 
In case of collision on z axis between the dock and the probe i added 2 more versions : one with z offset of the probe dock mount 1 mm lower and one 1 mm higher .

Klicky probe is a cheap and more precise alternative to various probe sensors (BlTouch, 3dTouch, inductive/capacitive sensors ) , and tested by me a standard deviation of 0.00065 
There are 4 parts needed : probe mount , probe (various probe lengths and even a switch extender if needed can be found on the klicky github) , probe dock and probe dock mount. 
 Inside the pictures folder i will put the print orientation. For the print settings i use a 0.2 layer height, 3 walls,5 top/bottom and 35% infill.

All the credits go to klicky probe creator and obvious to VzBot creators.
